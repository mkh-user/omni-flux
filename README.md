## Name
OmniFlux blends “Omni”—meaning universal—with “Flux,” a nod to both flow and flexibility. The name reflects a vision of a language that is all-encompassing yet adaptable, designed to evolve fluidly while offering comprehensive versatility.  

## Inspiration
OmniFlux is inspired by Python, GDScript, C++, Java, etc., and tries to overcome the limitations of each with the features of others. Of course, it's still a standalone language, and it also offers special features and structures that have been seen in few other languages (I've never seen them personally), most of which have to do with better code control, which is a big advantage for this scripting language.
